You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


int numJewelsInStones(char* J, char* S) 
{
    int n=0;
    int m=0;  //m用来记录S移动了多少，下一次比对时返回S的第一个字符位置
    while(*J!='\0')
    {
       while( *S!='\0')
       {
        if(*J==*S)
          n++;
           S+=1;
           m++;
       }
        J+=1;
        S-=m;
        m=0;
    }
    
    return n;
}
