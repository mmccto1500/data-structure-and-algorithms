The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

int hammingDistance(int x, int y)
{
    int i,z,k;
    int n=1;
    int res=0;
    z=x^y;

    for(i=0;i<32;i++)
    {
        k=n&z;
        if(k!=0)
            res++;
        n*=2;
       
    }
    return res;
}
